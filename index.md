I am a Ph.D. student researcher in the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh, currently working with professor Yuru Lin at [PICSO](https://picsolab.github.io/) lab. Prior to joining the program, I briefly worked at Amazon (Jordan) as a Software Development Engineer. I received my master's degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University, and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology.

I admire technicality in research, which comes from my passion for programming. I participated in several Hackathons and programming contests, such as ACM and IEEEXtreme, both nationally (Jordan) and regionally (Middle East). I am the recipient of the Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA) from A*STAR research, and the Royal Jordanian Court full scholarship for Undergraduates.

My research endeavors are situated at the crossroads of Machine Learning and Social Computing. My work explored diverse online social phenomena, including the examination of malicious activities on the dark web, investigating the interplay between online and offline hate content, and the intricate dynamics surrounding the spread and detection of conspiracy theories on platforms like Reddit. My primary focus centers on ensuring online information integrity by leveraging Network Science, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models to unveil biases, ensure fairness, and detect instances of misinformation.
