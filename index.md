I am a Ph.D. student researcher in the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh. Prior to joining the program, I briefly worked at Amazon (Jordan) as a Software Development Engineer. I received my master's degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University, and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology.

I admire technicality in research, which comes from my passion for programming. I participated in several Hackathons and programming contests, such as ACM and IEEEXtreme, both nationally (Jordan) and regionally (Middle East). I am the recipient of the Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA) from A*STAR research, and the Royal Jordanian Court full scholarship for Undergraduates.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Social Computing. Broadly, my work has investigated various online social phenomena (i.e. malicious activities on dark web, COVID and Conspiracy Theories in social media). I am interested in investigating the use of Machine Learning, Network Science, and Natural Language Processing to expose bias, ensure fairness, and detect online misconduct. I am eager to utilize different modalities (i.e. text and images) in social sciences context.
