I am a Ph.D. student researcher at the Computer Science department at University of Pittsburgh. I briefly worked at Amazon, Jordan before joining the program. I recieved my master's degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University, and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology. 

I participated in several programming contests, including ACM and IEEEXtreme, both nationally (Jordan) and regionally (Middle East). I also recieved the Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (SIPGA) from A*STAR research center, and the Royal Jordanian Court full scholarship for Undergraduates.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Social Computing. Broadly, my work has investigated various online social phenomena (i.e. dark web forums, social media). I am interested in investigating the use of Natural Language Processing and multi-modality methods to ensure fairness and detect online misconduct.
