# Chess
As a self-taught chess enthusiast who started playing late, I was overwhelmed with joy winning the University of Pittsburgh Open Chess Championship, 2021.

# Languages
I was always fascinated by languages as a way to connect with other cultures. This motivated me to learn basic German, Chinese, and Japanese. I can speak three languages; Arabic as a native language, English (I recently passed [Duolingo test](/files/duolingo.pdf) with a 145 score), and Spanish. I am currently working towards the Spanish Intermediate proficiency certificate. My next step is to work on my Chinese as a fourth language.

# Personal Computing Machine
For researchers in Machine Learning and NLP, accessibility to hardware resources is essential for learning and running experiments. Unfortunately, I didn't have access to such resources. I temporarily relied on google colab while building my low-budget powerful machine. The project lasted 5 months, during which I collected each part individually and built a machine able to run most deep-learning models. My practice enabled me to land an internship at the Collaboratory Against Hate research center.

# Programming
One of my proudest moments was during the ACM-JCPC programming competition, 2013. During the 5-hour coding challenge, we were behind on the scoreboard with no shot to compete for the top ten and qualify for the regional. I was able to correctly submit 2 questions within the last 10 minutes, a time when the scoreboard freezes and submissions are not evaluated. My team rejoiced to take third place and the "last-minute submission" award.
