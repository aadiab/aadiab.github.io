# Chess
As a self-taught chess enthusiast who started playing late, I was overwhelmed with joy winning the University of Pittsburgh Open Chess Championship, 2021.

# Programming
One of my proudest moments was during the ACM-JCPC programming competition, 2013. During the 5-hour coding challenge, we were behind on the scoreboard with no shot to compete for the top ten and qualify for the regional. I was able to correctly submit 2 questions within the last 10 minutes, a time when the scoreboard freezes and submissions are not evaluated. My team rejoiced to take third place and the "last-minute submission" award.
