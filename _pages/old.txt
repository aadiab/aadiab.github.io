# Languages
I was always fascinated by languages as a way to connect with other cultures. This motivated me to learn basic German, Chinese, and Japanese. I can speak three languages; Arabic as a native language, English (I recently passed [Duolingo test](/files/duolingo.pdf) with a 145 score), and Spanish. I am currently working towards the Spanish Intermediate proficiency certificate. My next step is to work on my Chinese as a fourth language.-->

# Personal Computing Machine
For researchers in Machine Learning and NLP, accessibility to hardware resources is essential for learning and running experiments. Unfortunately, I didn't have access to such resources. I temporarily relied on google colab while building my low-budget powerful machine. The project lasted 5 months, during which I collected each part individually and built a machine able to run most deep-learning models. My practice enabled me to land an internship at the Collaboratory Against Hate research center.
